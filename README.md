The classic version of Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM) Model was first used in the late 20th century where it created a module that allows for erosion estimation. 

The runoff is a crucial part of the model generated from the USDA soil conservation service, and it analyzes total precipitation for storms concerning other factors and estimates runoff daily. 

The model uses runoff, slope, vegetation cover, tillage rate, and other soil-water factors to estimate the soil erosion on a given plot. 

In the past decade, the APSIM group have transitioned from the classic version to the next generation. The APSIM next generation (APSIMx) has a user-friendly interface that makes interaction with input and output smoother compared to the classic model. Although APSIMx contains the runoff module, erosion is not yet an integral part of the modules (Keating et al., 2003).  

The goal of this research would be to predict the erosion using the properties of a given site and output data from the APSIM next generation and make a comparison to the classic version
